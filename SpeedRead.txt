As you are reading a line of text, your eye is actually constantly moving in a series of quick jumps and still intervals. You probably never noticed this because the jumps are so quick they take almost no time at all. However, each individual fixation can take up to half a second.

So the eye basically takes in small gulps of information at a time. In order to develop a speed reading eye , the goal is to gradually increase these short gulps into larger gulps.
The speed reading eye, concentrates it's fixation point towards the middle of each line of print. As the speed reading eye moves towards the next line or sentence it starts a couple words from the edge, rather than starting at the beginning.

With practice this becomes more comfortable and natural. The brain actually has a good idea of what is going to come next without having to fixate on each individual word. The speed reading eye only needs to check with peripheral vision to make sure the words were as expected.
